    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Georgios Panagopoulos and I'm a first year graduate student at the School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences (SAMPS) of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in the program "Physics and Technological Applications". My academic interests are Theoretical and Mathematical Physics.</p>
    <p>I am a member of the EPS Young Minds Section of NTUA, as well as the Hellenic Society for the Science and Technology of Condensed Matter. Additionally, I am one of the moderators of the SAMPS' students Google Drive.</p>
    <p>Finally, I have been elected representative of the students in the General Assembly of SAMPS for the year 2023.</p>

  <h3>Diploma Thesis Presentation</h3>
    <h5>03/10/2024</h5>
    <p>On 03/10/2024 I presented my diploma thesis, with which I completed my undergraduate studies. The title of my thesis was "Aspects of Contorted Geometry in the Early Universe and the Related Formalism". I want to thank all my friends that came to attend my presentation! My presentation is recorded (in greek) and can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYuMThanYuU">here</a>. You can download my slides <a href="./Files/main_page/G_Panag_Undergraduate_Thesis_Presentation.pdf" download>here</a>, and you can find my diploma thesis <a href="./Files/main_page/G_Panag_Undergraduate_Thesis_Greek.pdf" download>here (Greek)</a> and <a href="./Files/main_page/G_Panag_Undergraduate_Thesis_English.pdf" download>here (English)</a>.</p>
    <p>The topic of the presentation is Theoretical Physics. The abstract of the thesis is:</p>
	<p>This thesis explores gravitational theories with the presence of torsion. In the first chapter, after a brief introduction to the tetrad and differential forms formalisms, the Einstein-Cartan theory is developed. The Einstein-Cartan theory is a minimal extension of General Relativity that assumes a non-vanishing torsion. In the second chapter, the theory of Quantum Electrodynamics is considered in contorted spacetimes, with a dual purpose. The first is to show that in such a theory, spin is connected to torsion, much like mass is connected to curvature in General Relativity. The second is to show that, by making a reasonable assumption, torsion can be physically realized as an axion due to the anomaly present in the axial current in Quantum Electrodynamics. Finally, in the third chapter we consider a string-inspired model, in which the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond field takes on the role of torsion and thus behaves analogously with the torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory, producing an axionic degree of freedom. This theory is explored further, showing how, due to the anomalies present in the string theory, gravitational wave condensates in the early universe can explain inflation. This is done through an alternative cosmological model to Λ-Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM), called the Running Vacuum Model.</p>
	
  <h3>Student Representative Helios Page Up and Running!</h3>
    <h5>01/08/2023</h5>
    <p>Today marks the first day of the representatives Helios (Moodle) page being up and running! After many months of effort, we managed to get permission and set it up. Through the page, we're looking forward to have direct and both side communication with the student body. We are able to send announcements and conduct polls. Students are able to open forum conversations publicly or send private messages with their issues. We're looking forward to interact with you!</p>
    <p>We're also pleased to announced that we (finally) got permission and set up a student representatives email address: <a href="mailto:ekprosopoisemfe@mail.ntua.gr">ekprosopoisemfe@mail.ntua.gr</a>. You can message us here for any issues you're facing, and we'll be glad to help!</p>

  <h3>Presentation at SAMPS' Lounge Seminar</h3>
    <h5>11/05/2023</h5>
    <p>Today I had the honor to present an assignment of mine at Lounge Seminar, a SAMPS' seminar organized by students. My presentation's topic was "Magnetic Monopoles in Spin Ice. The presentation is recorded and you can find it (in greek) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1nmHICQVsQ">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmRcCQMAze8">here</a> (questions). You can download the slides of my presentation  <<a href="./Files/main_page/Georgios Panagopoulos - Magnetic Monopoles in Spin Ice - Presentation - English.pdf" download>here</a>.</p>
    <p>The topic of the presentation is a Condensed Matter Physics topic. This specific case is a great example that showcases how bizzare and unexpected phenomena and properties can arise in materials due to their complex structure.</p>
  
  <h3>Success in Elections for Representatives of Students in the General Assembly of SAMPS</h3>
    <h5>11/01/2023</h5>
    <p>I am proud to announce that I have been elected as a representative of the students of SAMPS in the General Assembly of the School!</p>
   <a href="http://semfe.ntua.gr/media/k2/attachments/ΑΠΟΤΕΛΕΣΜΑΤΑ_ΕΚΛΟΓΩΝ_ΓΙΑ_ΑΝΑΔΕΙΞΗ_ΕΚΠΡΟΣΩΠ.pdf">Election Results</a>
   <p>I promise to work hard, as promised, to ensure that our School gets even better and students have their issues resolved promptly.</p>
   <p>As you may notice, this website is under construction. I am working on it on my own, and I'll gradually be enriching it with content (notes and solved exercises on various topics). You can find a way to contact me in the Contact page in the navigation bar.</p>
